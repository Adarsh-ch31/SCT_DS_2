 Task 2: Titanic Data Cleaning & EDA

This task focuses on exploring the Titanic dataset (Kaggle) to understand relationships between variables and identify survival patterns.

Key Steps:
- Handled missing values in Age, Embarked, Cabin
- Explored survival rates by gender, class, and age
- Created visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib

Observations:
- Women had a much higher survival rate than men
- Passengers in 1st class had the highest survival rates
- Younger passengers had slightly better chances of survival
